#Bento Grid Design
This repository features a modern, responsive Bento Grid layout designed to showcase product features or content in an engaging and visually appealing manner. The design leverages the power of React.js for its component-based structure, Tailwind CSS for rapid styling, and Framer Motion for smooth, interactive animations.

#‚ú® Features
Responsive Layout: Adapts beautifully across various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) thanks to Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach and responsive design principles.

Dynamic Hover Effects: Each grid item (or "bento box") incorporates unique and smooth hover-triggered animations, enhancing user interaction.

#Image Transitions: Seamless cross-fading or sliding effects between different images or between images and videos on hover.

Text Animations: Text elements animate in and out of view or change position on hover.

Staggered Animations: Elements (like the "Four Titanium Colors" phones) load in a sequential, staggered fashion, creating a delightful visual experience.

Modular Component Structure: Built with React components, making it easy to understand, maintain, and extend. Each "bento box" can be a self-contained component.

Clean and Modern UI: A dark theme with rounded corners and subtle gradients provides a sleek and contemporary aesthetic.

#üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

Framer Motion: A production-ready motion library for React, enabling declarative animations.
